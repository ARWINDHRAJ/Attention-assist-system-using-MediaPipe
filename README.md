# Attention Assist System using MediaPipe

[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)](LICENSE)

## Overview

The Attention Assist System using MediaPipe is a project that utilizes the MediaPipe library to accurately detect and monitor attention levels in real time. The system is designed to function even in low-light conditions and can be deployed on edge devices by building the necessary packages. Utilizing MediaPipe, a cross-platform framework for creating computer vision pipelines, we created an attention support system. The system uses EAR and MAR to assess the driver's level of drowsiness. An alarm will sound to warn the driver if they are becoming sleepy.

## Features
- Real-time attention detection using MediaPipe.
- Robust performance in low-light environments.
- Support for deployment on edge devices.
- Easily customizable for specific use cases.

## Prerequisites
To run this project, you need to have the following prerequisites:

- Python 3.10.9 (recommended)
- MediaPipe
- OpenCV
- Math
- Pygame

You can install the required packages by running the following command:

```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/ARWINDHRAJ/Attention-assist-system-using-MediaPipe.git

## Usage
Follow the steps below to use the Attention Assist System:

1. Run the following command in the command prompt or terminal:
   ```shell
   python drowsiness.py
   ```
   This command will execute the `drowsiness.py` script.

2. Navigate to the "Drowsiness_Application" folder and run the "DrowsinessDetection.exe" file.
   ```
   cd Drowsiness_Application
   DrowsinessDetection.exe
   ```
   This step is necessary to launch the graphical user interface (GUI) of the Drowsiness Application.
